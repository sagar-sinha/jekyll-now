I study Computer Science at the <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a>. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from <a href="http://manipal.edu/mit.html">MIT Manipal</a> in 2015. I'm interested in Security of Distributed Systems, Scaling software to millions of users, Code Quality, Machine Learning applications in Finance and Agriculture. I care about the advances in understanding the semantics of the spoken languages by machines, government policies to ensure the safety of individuals and organisations in a connected world from black hats.
