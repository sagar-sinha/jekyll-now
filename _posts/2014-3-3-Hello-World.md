I'm Sagar and it's lovely to have you here. I blog about a lot of varied topics but mostly Computer Science, Cricket and Politics. I hope you have a good time reading some of my thoughts and I would love to hear from you. If you have any comments, suggestions or would like to chat just send me an email at sagar[at]gmail.com

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
